The Dutchman Erasmus \\n(1467 - 1536), however, is the author who most embodies, as a  symbol, European humanism.  \\n  \\nHumanism is characterized above all by the status it confers on ancient sources. The great authors of \\nGreek and Latin antiquity (e.g. Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Plutarch, Homer, Virgil, etc.) became models \\nto be imitated. The study of their texts had not di sappeared in the Middle Ages. But the rediscovery \\nand appropriation of these works accelerated.  \\n  \\nThis \"return\" to ancient sources was aided by the upheavals in Renaissance Europe, which began in \\n14th -century Italy. Alongside painters who drew inspiration from ancient mythology, or scholars who \\nsought to renew knowledge, Italian authors (Boccaccio, Dan te, Petrarch) initiated this movement of \\nimitation of the \"Ancients\" in literature (notably Virgil and Horace). Then, around 1450, the German \\nGutemberg (1400 - 1468) perfected printing by inventing movable metal type, which enabled books, \\nand therefore kno wledge, to be much more widely distributed. Finally, the retreat of the Byzantine \\nEmpire, heir to the Roman Empire and bearer of its Greco -Latin culture, followed by its final fall when \\nConstantinople was taken by the Ottomans in 1453, encouraged the trans fer of ancient knowledge \\nto Italy and thus to Europe.  \\n  \\nHumanists became familiar with ancient texts in their original language. They learned Latin, the \\nscholarly language of the day, as well as Greek and Hebrew. They translated texts and sought to \\nrediscover their original form. They went straight to the sourc e, sometimes discarding the \\ncommentaries and mistranslations of the Middle Ages. The latter was seen as a repulsive factor. The \\nmyth of the Middle Ages as barbaric, Gothic and dark was born.', metadata={'source': 'RAG_Data/Definition of literary movement.pdf', 'page': 0})"
